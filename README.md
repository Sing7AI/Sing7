## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js for server-side rendering
- **Styling**: Styled-components for component-based styling
- **State Management**: Redux for global state management
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API for sound generation and manipulation
- **Web3**: Ethers.js for Ethereum blockchain interaction
- **TypeScript**: For type safety across the codebase

### Component System Flow

The component architecture follows a hierarchical pattern:

```
           +----------------+
           |                |
           |  Page Layout   |
           |                |
           +-------+--------+
                   |
       +-----------+-----------+
       |                       |
+------v------+        +-------v-----+
|             |        |             |
|   Navbar    |        |    Main     |
|             |        |             |
+-------------+        +------+------+
                              |
                  +-----------+-----------+
                  |           |           |
            +-----v----+ +----v-----+ +---v------+
            |          | |          | |          |
            |  Studio  | |  Tools   | |  Web3    |
            |          | |          | |          |
            +----------+ +----------+ +----------+
```

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or other Web3 wallet for NFT functionality

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sing7AI/Sing7.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Sing7

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ID=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID=your_infura_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/
```

## Component System

### Core Components

The Sing7 platform includes several specialized audio tool components:

#### Studio Component

The Studio component serves as the main container for music creation tools:

```tsx
// src/components/audio/Studio/index.tsx (simplified)
const Studio = ({ className }) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('rhythm');
  const [projectName, setProjectName] = useState('New Project');

  const renderActiveTool = () => {
    switch (activeTab) {
      case 'rhythm': return <RhythmLab />;
      case 'melody': return <MelodyMaker />;
      case 'chord': return <ChordMaker />;
      case 'mixer': return <MixerPlaceholder />;
      default: return <RhythmLab />;
    }
  };

  return (
    <StudioContainer>
      <StudioHeader>
        {/* Navigation tabs */}
      </StudioHeader>
      <ToolContainer>
        {renderActiveTool()}
      </ToolContainer>
    </StudioContainer>
  );
};
```

#### ChordMaker Component

The ChordMaker allows users to create chord progressions:

```tsx
// src/components/audio/ChordMaker/index.tsx (simplified)
const ChordMaker = ({ className }) => {
  const [selectedRoot, setSelectedRoot] = useState('C');
  const [selectedType, setSelectedType] = useState('major');
  const [chordProgression, setChordProgression] = useState([
    { root: 'C', type: 'major' },
    { root: 'G', type: 'major' },
    { root: 'A', type: 'minor' },
    { root: 'F', type: 'major' },
  ]);

  // Functions for managing chord selections and playback
  
  return (
    <ChordMakerContainer>
      {/* UI for chord selection and progression building */}
    </ChordMakerContainer>
  );
};
```

## Data Flow

Sing7 implements a unidirectional data flow pattern using Redux for state management.

```
          +----------------+
          |                |
    +---->|      Store     +---+
    |     |                |   |
    |     +----------------+   |
    |                          |
    |                          |
+---+----+              +------v---+
|        |              |          |
| Action |              | Reducers |
|        |              |          |
+---^----+              +------+---+
    |                          |
    |                          |
    |     +----------------+   |
    |     |                |   |
    +-----+   Components   |<--+
          |                |
          +----------------+
```

### State Management

The Redux store manages several slices of state:

- **Audio State**: Controls playback, current track data, and audio settings
- **UI State**: Manages UI modes, theme settings, and responsive layout adjustments
- **Web3 State**: Handles wallet connection, NFT metadata, and transaction status

### API Integration

The platform connects to external services through service modules:

```tsx
// src/services/audioSlice.js (example)
export const audioSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'audio',
  initialState: {
    isPlaying: false,
    tempo: 120,
    currentTrack: null,
    // ...other audio state
  },
  reducers: {
    setPlaying: (state, action) => {
      state.isPlaying = action.payload;
    },
    // ...other reducers
  }
});
```

## Theme System

Sing7 uses a theme system implemented with styled-components for consistent styling.

### Theme Definition

```tsx
// src/styles/theme.ts
export const defaultTheme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#57b9f8',
    secondary: '#f8ce57',
    background: '#121212',
    textLight: '#ffffff',
    textSecondary: '#e1e1e1',
    cardBackground: '#1d1d1d',
  },
  fontWeights: {
    regular: 400,
    medium: 500,
    semiBold: 600,
    bold: 700,
  },
  breakpoints: {
    sm: '576px',
    md: '768px',
    lg: '992px',
    xl: '1200px',
  },
  borderRadius: {
    small: '4px',
    medium: '8px',
    large: '12px',
    round: '50px',
  },
};
```

### Theme Integration

Themes are applied using the styled-components ThemeProvider:

```tsx
// src/pages/_app.tsx (simplified)
const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

## Web3 Integration

Sing7 integrates with blockchain technology for NFT minting and marketplace functionality.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use functional components with hooks for React code
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper type definitions
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names

### Component Creation

When creating new components:

1. Place the component in the appropriate directory under `src/components`
2. Use styled-components for styling
3. Define proper TypeScript interfaces for props
4. Export the component as the default export

```tsx
// Template for new components
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

interface ComponentProps {
  // Props definition
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ /* props */ }) => {
  // Component logic
  
  return (
    <Container>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </Container>
  );
};

// Styled components
const Container = styled.div`
  // Styling
`;

export default MyComponent;
```
