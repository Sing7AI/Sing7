# üîê Sing7AI Exclusive SSH Key Setup Instructions

## SSH Key Information üîë

**Exclusive SSH Key for Sing7AI:**
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDQuqApwbxa6wWaoxLwYzoTB5RxZBw+EOrHP1+IlNkpB nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com
```

This key is stored at: `~/.ssh/sing7ai_exclusive_key`

## Adding the SSH Key to GitHub

1. **Log in to GitHub** with your Sing7AI account (nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com)
2. **Go to Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key**
3. **Title**: "Sing7 Exclusive Key"
4. **Key type**: "Authentication Key"
5. **Key**: Copy and paste the SSH key shown above
6. **Click "Add SSH key"**

## Testing the Connection

After adding the key to your GitHub account, test the connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com-sing7ai-exclusive
```

If successful, you should see a message like:
```
Hi Sing7AI! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Note: If you still see "Hi CtoryAI!" instead of "Hi Sing7AI!", there may be an issue with your GitHub account settings.

## Pushing to GitHub

Once the SSH connection is working correctly, you can push your code:

```bash
# Push to GitHub using the exclusive SSH configuration
git push -u sing7ai-exclusive main
```

## How This Exclusive Setup Works

The setup has several safeguards to prevent conflicts with other GitHub accounts:

1. **Custom Host Name**: Using `github.com-sing7ai-exclusive` instead of plain `github.com`
2. **IdentitiesOnly Parameter**: The SSH config includes `IdentitiesOnly yes` which forces SSH to use only the specified key
3. **Isolated File Name**: The key uses a distinct file name that won't be accidentally loaded by other configurations

## SSH Configuration Details

The SSH configuration for this exclusive key is:

```
Host github.com-sing7ai-exclusive
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/sing7ai_exclusive_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

## Fallback: Bundle Upload Method

If direct SSH access still doesn't work, you can use the bundle file method as described in our previous instructions:

1. Use the `FINAL_BUNDLE_SING7.bundle` file
2. Follow the upload steps on a computer where you can authenticate as nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com
