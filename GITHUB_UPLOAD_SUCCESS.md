# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Setup Completed
- ✅ Local repository initialized with initial commit
- ✅ Project files organized and committed
- ✅ Logo added to the project
- ✅ Documentation updated and English version created
- ✅ Bundle file created: `sing7_updated.bundle`
- ✅ Archive file created: `Sing7_updated.tar.gz`

## Next Steps

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Sign in to your GitHub account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Set the repository name to "Sing7"
4. Optionally add a repository description
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Upload Using Bundle File

Since direct push is having permission issues, use the bundle file approach:

```bash
# On a system with proper GitHub access:
git clone sing7_updated.bundle sing7_repo_clone
cd sing7_repo_clone
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Sing7AI/Sing7.git  # Replace with your actual repository URL
git push --all origin
```

### 3. Alternatively, Upload Files Manually

If the bundle approach doesn't work, you can manually upload the files:

1. Extract the `Sing7_updated.tar.gz` archive
2. Go to your GitHub repository page
3. Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
4. Drag and drop the extracted files or use the file chooser
5. Add a commit message: "Initial project upload"
6. Click "Commit changes"

### 4. Verify Repository Content

After upload, verify that all files are correctly displayed in the repository:
- The logo should appear in the README
- All code files should be present
- Documentation should be in English

### 5. Set up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to showcase your project:
1. Go to the repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Select the "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait a few minutes for your site to be published
