# GitHub SSH Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up SSH access to the Sing7AI/Sing7 repository:

## 1. SSH Key Information

An SSH key has been generated for you:

- **Private Key Location**: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sing7ai`
- **Public Key**: 
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIFIgaxKmEopbzCi1bjkDcI3e4DI7hPu2xL7b1uIvXfo nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com
```

## 2. SSH Config Information

The SSH configuration has been set up in your `~/.ssh/config` file with the following entry:

```
Host github.com-sing7ai
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sing7ai
```

This configuration allows you to use the specific SSH key when connecting to the repository.

## 3. Add SSH Key to GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub with your account (nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com)
2. Navigate to Settings (click your profile picture in the top right and select "Settings")
3. Select "SSH and GPG keys" from the left sidebar
4. Click "New SSH key"
5. Title: "Sing7 Project Key"
6. Key Type: "Authentication Key"
7. Key: Paste the public key (shown above)
8. Click "Add SSH key"

## 4. Create the Repository (if it doesn't exist)

1. Go to GitHub and click the "+" in the top right, then select "New repository"
2. Set "Sing7AI" as the owner (create the organization first if needed)
3. Set "Sing7" as the repository name
4. Select "Public" or "Private" as desired
5. Do not initialize with a README or add .gitignore/license
6. Click "Create repository"

## 5. Upload Your Code

You have two options for uploading the code:

### Option A: Using Git with SSH

Once you've added the SSH key to GitHub, try pushing again:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Using the Bundled Files

If you encounter issues with SSH, you can use the bundle files:

1. Use `sing7_complete.bundle` - Contains all Git history
   ```bash
   # On your local machine or any computer with Git installed:
   git clone sing7_complete.bundle sing7_repo
   cd sing7_repo
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com-sing7ai:Sing7AI/Sing7.git
   git push --all origin
   ```

2. Or use `../Sing7_complete.tar.gz` - Contains just the files
   - Extract the archive
   - Upload files through GitHub's web interface

## 6. Verify Repository Configuration

The repository has been configured with:
```
[user]
    name = Sing7
    email = nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com
[alias]
    br = branch
    co = checkout
    cm = commit -am
    df = diff
    st = status
    pl = pull
    ps = push
    cob = checkout -b
[log]
    date = iso
[init]
    defaultBranch = main
```

All commits use the message "Sing7 V1.01"
