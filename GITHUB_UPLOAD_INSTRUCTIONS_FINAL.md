# Sing7 GitHub Upload Instructions (Final)

Since direct push to GitHub encountered permission issues, please use the bundle method to upload the codebase to GitHub.

## What is the Bundle File?

The bundle file (`Sing7_updated_bundle.bundle`) contains the entire Git repository, including all commits, branches, and tags. This allows you to transfer the repository without requiring direct SSH access from this machine.

## Upload Steps

### Method 1: Using the Bundle File

1. Copy the bundle file to a computer with GitHub access:
   ```
   Sing7_updated_bundle.bundle
   ```

2. On the computer with GitHub access, run these commands:

   ```bash
   # Clone from the bundle file
   git clone Sing7_updated_bundle.bundle sing7_repo
   
   # Navigate to the cloned repository
   cd sing7_repo
   
   # Set the correct remote URL
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Sing7AI/Sing7.git
   
   # Push all branches to GitHub
   git push --all origin
   ```

### Method 2: Creating a New Repository Manually

If the bundle method doesn't work, you can create a new repository manually:

1. Log in to GitHub with your account (nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com)
2. Create a new repository named "Sing7" under the "Sing7AI" organization
3. Follow GitHub's instructions for pushing an existing repository
4. Copy all files from this project to the new repository
5. Commit and push using the GitHub instructions

## Verifying the Upload

After uploading, verify that all files are present on GitHub:

1. All source code files
2. All documentation files
3. All setup scripts

## SSH Key Setup (For Future Use)

To enable direct push in the future:

1. Log in to GitHub with your account (nxkaaowpif11@hotmail.com)
2. Go to Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
3. Title: "Sing7 Project Key"
4. Key type: "Authentication Key"
5. Key: Copy the SSH public key from this file:
   ```
   ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sing7ai.pub
   ```
6. Click "Add SSH key"
